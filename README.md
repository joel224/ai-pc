created at 2024 , before open ai's operator.

this project is about automated web browsing. it works similar to open ai's operator on surface level( since this project only use a single text based ai model for cost effectiveness and lack of ai models at 2024) 

currently the project can locate everything in a browser

i regret a lot to discontinueing this , due to less support and lack of team due to its heavy complexity.
